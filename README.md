## FINAL PROJECT ##

Develop a web application in which students can find tutors near them, and set up scheduled tutoring sessions.

* For testing Stripe Checkout, use "customer@example.com" for  email, "4242 4242 4242 4242" as Card Number, any future date as expiration, and any CVC.

#### Deploy to Heroku (Submit link on Blackboard)

1. Do these ONCE only per project
   1. Create a Heroku server: `heroku create`
   2. Create a database for your server: `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev`
2. Add all your changes on git and commit those changes
3. Push the code to Heroku: `git push heroku master`
4. I preconfigured the necessary files for this to work.
5. Verify all is working and submit your links (github and heroku) to me.
